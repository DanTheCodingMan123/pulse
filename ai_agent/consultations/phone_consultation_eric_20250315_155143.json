      "doctor": "Based on what you've told me, Hi Eric! From what you've described, it sounds like you're dealing with symptoms that could point to a common cold or possibly the flu - the combination of sore throat, congestion, body aches, and fever is pretty typical for these viral infections.\n\nSince you're already taking Claritin (which helps more with allergies), you might want to consider over-the-counter medications specifically for cold/flu symptoms. Things like:\n- Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever and body aches\n- A decongestant for the stuffiness\n- Throat lozenges for the sore throat\n\nSome other things that can help:\n- Rest (your body needs it!)\n- Stay hydrated with plenty of fluids\n- Try gargling with warm salt water for your throat\n- Use a humidifier if you have one\n\nGiven your age and lack of complicated medical history, this should resolve on its own within a week or so. However, if your fever gets high (over 103\u00b0F), symptoms worsen significantly, or you're not better in 7-10 days, you should see a doctor. Also, consider getting tested for COVID-19 since symptoms can be similar. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
